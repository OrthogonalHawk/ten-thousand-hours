History of Cryptography:
 - letter frequency attacks require a certain amount of ciphertext before
    they can be executed
 - many historical ciphers exposed critical information that enabled
    side channel attacks (letter frequency)

Discrete Probability I:

Discrete Probability II:

One Time Pad:
 - perfect secrecy means that a given ciphertext reveals nothing about
    the plaintext. In other words, the probability that a given ciphertext
    came from one key/message pair is equal to the probability that it
    came from another key/message pair.
 - perfect secrecy requires a key that is as long or longer than the
    message that it encrypts (proved by Shannon).
